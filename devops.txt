1. Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Cloud-based Web Application

Project Title

> Cloud-Native Application Deployment Automation using AWS and Jenkins



Client Requirement (SRS Summary)

Our organization requires an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Java-based web application to AWS.
The solution should enable continuous integration, automated testing, and seamless deployment to production without manual intervention.

Functional Requirements

1. Source code should be fetched automatically from GitHub on every commit.


2. The build process should use Maven to compile and package the code.


3. Jenkins must trigger the pipeline for build → test → deploy stages.


4. The application should be Dockerized and pushed to AWS ECR.


5. Deployment should occur on AWS ECS or EKS cluster.


6. Terraform must provision infrastructure (VPC, EC2, IAM roles, ECS/EKS).


7. Logs and metrics should be monitored via CloudWatch.


8. Alerts should be sent using SNS for failed deployments.


9. The entire deployment must follow Agile SDLC, tracked in Jira.



Non-Functional Requirements

Deployment frequency: ≤ 15 minutes per release

Zero-downtime deployment (rolling or blue-green)

Secure IAM role-based access

Version-controlled infrastructure (Terraform)

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration Management Automation

Project Title

> Automated Infrastructure Provisioning and Configuration using Terraform and Ansible



Client Requirement (SRS Summary)

The client needs a fully automated solution to provision and configure cloud infrastructure on AWS using Terraform and Ansible.
The goal is to reduce manual setup, improve scalability, and ensure consistent environments for development, staging, and production.

Functional Requirements

1. Use Terraform to create:

Custom VPC with subnets

EC2 instances with proper IAM roles

S3 buckets for data storage

Security Groups and Key Pairs



2. Use Ansible to configure EC2 instances (install Docker, Nginx, app dependencies).


3. Integrate Terraform + Ansible with Jenkins pipeline.


4. Implement version control through GitHub.


5. Configure CloudWatch to monitor system metrics.


6. Logs must be shipped to Splunk for centralized analysis.



Non-Functional Requirements

Reproducible environments via IaC

Modular and reusable Terraform scripts

Role-based access for security compliance

3. Containerized Microservices Deployment with Monitoring

Project Title

> Scalable Microservices Deployment using Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), and CloudWatch



Client Requirement (SRS Summary)

The client’s application consists of multiple microservices that must be containerized, orchestrated, and deployed on AWS EKS.
They also require centralized monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities.

Functional Requirements

1. Containerize microservices using Docker.


2. Push images to AWS ECR.


3. Use Terraform to provision EKS cluster, node groups, IAM, and networking.


4. Automate deployment using Jenkins pipelines.


5. Implement horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU usage.


6. Configure CloudWatch dashboards for cluster and pod metrics.


7. Integrate with Splunk for log analytics.


8. Store application backups in S3.



Non-Functional Requirements

High availability (min 2 replicas per service)

Auto-recovery of failed pods

Secure communication between services (private VPC)



---
4. DevSecOps Pipeline with Automated Security Scanning

Project Title

> Secure CI/CD Pipeline with Vulnerability Scanning and Compliance Checks



Client Requirement (SRS Summary)

The client wants to ensure every code deployment undergoes automated security and compliance checks before reaching production.
The system must integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines and AWS infrastructure.

Functional Requirements

1. Jenkins pipeline must run:

SonarQube for code quality analysis

Trivy for Docker image vulnerability scanning

Unit and integration tests before deployment



2. Store all build artifacts in S3.


3. Securely push approved Docker images to ECR.


4. Deploy applications to EKS cluster via Terraform and Ansible.


5. Generate compliance reports automatically.


6. Log all security incidents to Splunk.


7. Manage issue tracking via Jira.



Non-Functional Requirements

Compliance with OWASP and CIS benchmarks

Encrypted communication for all data transfers

Minimal pipeline latency increase (<5%)

5. SRE-Focused Monitoring and Auto-Healing System

Project Title

> Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring and Self-Healing Automation



Client Requirement (SRS Summary)

The client needs an automated monitoring system that can detect failures in AWS resources and trigger self-healing actions to maintain uptime.

Functional Requirements

1. Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor EC2, EKS, and application metrics.


2. Create CloudWatch alarms for CPU, memory, and error rates.


3. Trigger AWS Lambda functions (Python-based) to restart failed instances or pods.


4. Send notifications to Slack / Email via SNS.


5. Aggregate logs in Splunk for analysis.


6. Maintain all automation scripts in GitHub.


7. Track incidents in Jira under SRE board.



Non-Functional Requirements

Uptime target: 99.9%

Mean time to recovery (MTTR): < 2 minutes

Scalable monitoring with minimal cost overhead
